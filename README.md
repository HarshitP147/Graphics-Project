This is the final submission for the subject of Computer Graphics CSU44052 - Trinity College Dublin.

The theme of this project is "Towards a Futuristic Emrald Isle".

To run this project in your computer, ensure you have `cmake` installed.

Then:
```
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake ..
make
```

> [!Tip]
> You can also use VSCode's C/C++ and Cmake extensions to generate the files

This will compile the entire project and generate a `main.exe` file.

Run `main.exe` and view

> [!Note]
> It is recommended that you run the executable on a dedicated graphics card. You can select the same from your GPU control panel (e.g Nvidia Control Panel).
